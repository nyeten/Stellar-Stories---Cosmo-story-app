# Stellar Stories Interactive Learning App

A JavaFX educational application created for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge (2025)**.  
Developed collaboratively over two days, this app visually explains **solar flares**, **coronal mass ejections (CMEs)**, and **space weather impacts on Earth** through interactive slideshows and simple animations.

---

## Overview

The Solar Storm Interactive Learning App helps users understand how solar activity affects Earth‚Äôs technology and environment.  
The project combines real NASA imagery, visual storytelling, and JavaFX interactivity to create a short digital learning experience suitable for classrooms or public outreach.

Users can navigate from a **main menu** to four themed modules, each designed as a mini slideshow or tutorial:
1. **Solar Flares**  
2. **Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)**  
3. **Impacts on Earth**  
4. **Protecting Earth**

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Main Menu Navigation** ‚Äì Clean JavaFX UI with buttons linking to each educational module.  
- **Interactive Slideshows** ‚Äì Each topic uses multiple slides, combining NASA visuals, text, and transitions.  
- **Slider-Based Animation** ‚Äì The Solar Flare and CME modules include draggable sliders that change images to simulate the stages of a solar event.  
- **Educational Focus** ‚Äì Explains space weather concepts like flares, CMEs, auroras, and their real-world impacts on satellites, aviation, and power grids.  
- **Custom Graphics** ‚Äì Canva and NASA public-domain images layered together for clarity and engagement.

## Example Module: Solar Flares

The `SolarFlare` class demonstrates how JavaFX can be used to link a slider to a sequence of images and text descriptions.  
As the user moves the slider, the app updates:
- The main image (representing flare progression)
- The caption text describing each stage

This creates an animated, educational ‚Äúmini-simulation‚Äù of a solar flare‚Äôs life cycle.
